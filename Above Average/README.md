ABOVE AVERAGE 

1 This python code runs via sys stdin and stdout, for example in linux 
run `cat 1.in | python3 aboveAverage.py`

2 Note: This Python code is  not good at debugging add todo list 

3 Todo: Add try except blocks and sys.stderr to get detailed errors in order to debug.

4 Cheers! Happy coding 
  And One more Thing if you want to run exceutable file , add shebang at the starting of the code `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
